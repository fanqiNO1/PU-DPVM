# This is a PyTorch implementation of the [Predicting Visible Image Differences Under Varying Display Brightness and Viewing Distance](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Ye_Predicting_Visible_Image_Differences_Under_Varying_Display_Brightness_and_Viewing_CVPR_2019_paper.html) in CVPR 2019

#Code Usage:


#Sample Results:


#Notes:
We have implemented network architecture used in the paper. In the future, we will migrate the loss function from tensorflow to PyTorch. This can serve as a basic implementation of the paper and a footfold for future works.
